== OpenSeadragon 

This project has moved!

Thanks to Ian Gilman, one of the original authors of OpenSeadragon, we have a new github organization, better project component seperation to reduce the size of the repo developers need to clone to contibute, a move to Node based build tools, and most importantly more core contributors to respond to issues and feature requests.

I'd also like to thank everyone who has contributed so far, OpenSeadragon is going places!

Please see http://github.com/openseadragon for our new organization. We'll continue to monitor this repo for tickets and forks to help everyone make the move smoothly.

Sincerely,
Christopher Thatcher
