<span class='line'> 11</span>  * OpenSeadragon is provides an html interface for creating 
<span class='line'> 12</span>  * deep zoom user interfaces.  The simplest examples include deep 
<span class='line'> 13</span>  * zoom for large resolution images, and complex examples include
<span class='line'> 14</span>  * zoomable map interfaces driven by SVG files.

<span class='line'> 99</span>   *
<span class='line'>100</span>   * @param {Object} options All required and optional settings for instantiating
<span class='line'>101</span>   *     a new instance of an OpenSeadragon image viewer. 
<span class='line'>102</span>   *
<span class='line'>103</span>   * @param {String} options.xmlPath 
<span class='line'>104</span>   *     DEPRECATED. A relative path to load a DZI file from the server. 
<span class='line'>105</span>   *     Prefer the newer options.tileSources.
<span class='line'>106</span>   *
<span class='line'>107</span>   * @param {Array|String|Function|Object[]|Array[]|String[]|Function[]} options.tileSources
<span class='line'>108</span>   *     As an Array, the tileSource can hold either be all Objects or mixed 
<span class='line'>109</span>   *     types of Arrays of Objects, String, Function. When a value is a String, 
<span class='line'>110</span>   *     the tileSource is used to create a {@link OpenSeadragon.DziTileSource}.  
<span class='line'>111</span>   *     When a value is a Function, the function is used to create a new 
<span class='line'>112</span>   *     {@link OpenSeadragon.TileSource} whose abstract method 
<span class='line'>113</span>   *     getUrl( level, x, y ) is implemented by the function. Finally, when it 
<span class='line'>114</span>   *     is an Array of objects, it is used to create a 
<span class='line'>115</span>   *     {@link OpenSeadragon.LegacyTileSource}.
<span class='line'>116</span>   *
<span class='line'>117</span>   * @param {Boolean} [options.debugMode=true]
<span class='line'>118</span>   *     Currently does nothing. TODO: provide an in-screen panel providing event
<span class='line'>119</span>   *     detail feedback.
<span class='line'>120</span>   *
<span class='line'>121</span>   * @param {Number} [options.animationTime=1.5]
<span class='line'>122</span>   *     Specifies the animation duration per each {@link OpenSeadragon.Spring}
<span class='line'>123</span>   *     which occur when the image is dragged or zoomed.
<span class='line'>124</span>   *
<span class='line'>125</span>   * @param {Number} [options.blendTime=0.5] 
<span class='line'>126</span>   *     Specifies the duration of animation as higher or lower level tiles are
<span class='line'>127</span>   *     replacing the existing tile.
<span class='line'>128</span>   *
<span class='line'>129</span>   * @param {Boolean} [options.alwaysBlend=false]
<span class='line'>130</span>   *     Forces the tile to always blend.  By default the tiles skip blending
<span class='line'>131</span>   *     when the blendTime is surpassed and the current animation frame would
<span class='line'>132</span>   *     not complete the blend.
<span class='line'>133</span>   *
<span class='line'>134</span>   * @param {Boolean} [options.autoHideControls=true]
<span class='line'>135</span>   *     If the user stops interacting with the viewport, fade the navigation 
<span class='line'>136</span>   *     controls.  Useful for presentation since the controls are by default
<span class='line'>137</span>   *     floated on top of the image the user is viewing.
<span class='line'>138</span>   *
<span class='line'>139</span>   * @param {Boolean} [options.immediateRender=false]
<span class='line'>140</span>   *     Render the best closest level first, ignoring the lowering levels which
<span class='line'>141</span>   *     provide the effect of very blurry to sharp. It is recommended to change 
<span class='line'>142</span>   *     setting to true for mobile devices.
<span class='line'>143</span>   *
<span class='line'>144</span>   * @param {Boolean} [options.wrapHorizontal=false]
<span class='line'>145</span>   *     Set to true to force the image to wrap horizontally within the viewport.
<span class='line'>146</span>   *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.
<span class='line'>147</span>   *
<span class='line'>148</span>   * @param {Boolean} [options.wrapVertical=false]
<span class='line'>149</span>   *     Set to true to force the image to wrap vertically within the viewport.
<span class='line'>150</span>   *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.
<span class='line'>151</span>   *
<span class='line'>152</span>   * @param {Number} [options.minZoomImageRatio=0.8]
<span class='line'>153</span>   *     The minimum percentage ( expressed as a number between 0 and 1 ) of 
<span class='line'>154</span>   *     the viewport height or width at which the zoom out will be constrained.
<span class='line'>155</span>   *     Setting it to 0, for example will allow you to zoom out infinitly.
<span class='line'>156</span>   *
<span class='line'>157</span>   * @param {Number} [options.maxZoomPixelRatio=2]
<span class='line'>158</span>   *     The maximum ratio to allow a zoom-in to affect the highest level pixel
<span class='line'>159</span>   *     ratio. This can be set to Infinity to allow 'infinite' zooming into the
<span class='line'>160</span>   *     image though it is less effective visually if the HTML5 Canvas is not 
<span class='line'>161</span>   *     availble on the viewing device.
<span class='line'>162</span>   *
<span class='line'>163</span>   * @param {Number} [options.visibilityRatio=0.5]
<span class='line'>164</span>   *     The percentage ( as a number from 0 to 1 ) of the source image which
<span class='line'>165</span>   *     must be kept within the viewport.  If the image is dragged beyond that
<span class='line'>166</span>   *     limit, it will 'bounce' back until the minimum visibility ration is 
<span class='line'>167</span>   *     achieved.  Setting this to 0 and wrapHorizontal ( or wrapVertical ) to
<span class='line'>168</span>   *     true will provide the effect of an infinitely scrolling viewport.
<span class='line'>169</span>   *
<span class='line'>170</span>   * @param {Number} [options.springStiffness=5.0]
<span class='line'>171</span>   *
<span class='line'>172</span>   * @param {Number} [options.imageLoaderLimit=0]
<span class='line'>173</span>   *     The maximum number of image requests to make concurrently.  By default
<span class='line'>174</span>   *     it is set to 0 allowing the browser to make the maximum number of
<span class='line'>175</span>   *     image requests in parallel as allowed by the browsers policy.
<span class='line'>176</span>   *
<span class='line'>177</span>   * @param {Number} [options.clickTimeThreshold=200]
<span class='line'>178</span>   *     If multiple mouse clicks occurs within less than this number of 
<span class='line'>179</span>   *     milliseconds, treat them as a single click.
<span class='line'>180</span>   *
<span class='line'>181</span>   * @param {Number} [options.clickDistThreshold=5]
<span class='line'>182</span>   *     If a mouse or touch drag occurs and the distance to the starting drag
<span class='line'>183</span>   *     point is less than this many pixels, ignore the drag event.
<span class='line'>184</span>   *
<span class='line'>185</span>   * @param {Number} [options.zoomPerClick=2.0]
<span class='line'>186</span>   *     The "zoom distance" per mouse click or touch tap.
<span class='line'>187</span>   *
<span class='line'>188</span>   * @param {Number} [options.zoomPerScroll=1.2]
<span class='line'>189</span>   *     The "zoom distance" per mouse scroll or touch pinch.
<span class='line'>190</span>   *
<span class='line'>191</span>   * @param {Number} [options.zoomPerSecond=2.0]
<span class='line'>192</span>   *     The number of seconds to animate a single zoom event over.
<span class='line'>193</span>   *
<span class='line'>194</span>   * @param {Boolean} [options.showNavigationControl=true]
<span class='line'>195</span>   *     Set to false to prevent the appearance of the default navigation controls.
<span class='line'>196</span>   *
<span class='line'>197</span>   * @param {Number} [options.controlsFadeDelay=2000]
<span class='line'>198</span>   *     The number of milliseconds to wait once the user has stopped interacting
<span class='line'>199</span>   *     with the interface before begining to fade the controls. Assumes
<span class='line'>200</span>   *     showNavigationControl and autoHideControls are both true.
<span class='line'>201</span>   *
<span class='line'>202</span>   * @param {Number} [options.controlsFadeLength=1500]
<span class='line'>203</span>   *     The number of milliseconds to animate the controls fading out.
<span class='line'>204</span>   *
<span class='line'>205</span>   * @param {Number} [options.maxImageCacheCount=100]
<span class='line'>206</span>   *     The max number of images we should keep in memory (per drawer).
<span class='line'>207</span>   *
<span class='line'>208</span>   * @param {Number} [options.minPixelRatio=0.5]
<span class='line'>209</span>   *     The higher the minPixelRatio, the lower the quality of the image that
<span class='line'>210</span>   *     is considered sufficient to stop rendering a given zoom level.  For
<span class='line'>211</span>   *     example, if you are targeting mobile devices with less bandwith you may 
<span class='line'>212</span>   *     try setting this to 1.5 or higher.
<span class='line'>213</span>   *
<span class='line'>214</span>   * @param {Boolean} [options.mouseNavEnabled=true]
<span class='line'>215</span>   *     Is the user able to interact with the image via mouse or touch. Default 
<span class='line'>216</span>   *     interactions include draging the image in a plane, and zooming in toward
<span class='line'>217</span>   *     and away from the image.
<span class='line'>218</span>   *
<span class='line'>219</span>   * @param {Boolean} [options.preserveViewport=false]
<span class='line'>220</span>   *     If the viewer has been configured with a sequence of tile sources, then
<span class='line'>221</span>   *     normally navigating to through each image resets the viewport to 'home'
<span class='line'>222</span>   *     position.  If preserveViewport is set to true, then the viewport position
<span class='line'>223</span>   *     is preserved when navigating between images in the sequence.
<span class='line'>224</span>   *
<span class='line'>225</span>   * @param {String} [options.prefixUrl='']
<span class='line'>226</span>   *     Appends the prefixUrl to navImages paths, which is very useful
<span class='line'>227</span>   *     since the default paths are rarely useful for production
<span class='line'>228</span>   *     environments.
<span class='line'>229</span>   *
<span class='line'>230</span>   * @param {Object} [options.navImages=]
<span class='line'>231</span>   *     An object with a property for each button or other built-in navigation
<span class='line'>232</span>   *     control, eg the current 'zoomIn', 'zoomOut', 'home', and 'fullpage'.
<span class='line'>233</span>   *     Each of those in turn provides an image path for each state of the botton
<span class='line'>234</span>   *     or navigation control, eg 'REST', 'GROUP', 'HOVER', 'PRESS'. Finally the
<span class='line'>235</span>   *     image paths, by default assume there is a folder on the servers root path
<span class='line'>236</span>   *     called '/images', eg '/images/zoomin_rest.png'.  If you need to adjust
<span class='line'>237</span>   *     these paths, prefer setting the option.prefixUrl rather than overriding 
<span class='line'>238</span>   *     every image path directly through this setting.

<span class='line'>5230</span>  * The LegacyTileSource allows simple, traditional image pyramids to be loaded
<span class='line'>5231</span>  * into an OpenSeadragon Viewer.  Basically, this translates to the historically
<span class='line'>5232</span>  * common practice of starting with a 'master' image, maybe a tiff for example,
<span class='line'>5233</span>  * and generating a set of 'service' images like one or more thumbnails, a medium 
<span class='line'>5234</span>  * resolution image and a high resolution image in standard web formats like
<span class='line'>5235</span>  * png or jpg.

<span class='line'>5238</span>  *      a 'url', a 'width', and a 'height'.  Overriding classes can expect more
<span class='line'>5239</span>  *      properties but these properties are sufficient for this implementation.
<span class='line'>5240</span>  *      Additionally, the files are required to be listed in order from
<span class='line'>5241</span>  *      smallest to largest.
